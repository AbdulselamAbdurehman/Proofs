Statement
	P(n): The sum of all positive integers upto n is n(n+1)/2.
Proof by Ordinary Induction
	Base case:
		when n = 1, P(n) is true.
	Inductive case:
		P(n) is true by assumption => 1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2
		Adding n+1 to both sides gives 1 + 2 + ... + n + (n + 1) = n(n+1)/2 + (n + 1) = (n+1)(n+2)/2 = P(n+1) 
				Done.
