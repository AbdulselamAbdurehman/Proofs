Sure, let's go through the proof of Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm, also known as the "Hare and Tortoise" algorithm. This algorithm is used to detect cycles in a sequence of values or in a linked list. The proof involves two main cases: when there is a cycle and when there is not. 

### Case 1: When there is a cycle

#### Part A: The Hare and Tortoise Always Meet

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Let’s denote the sequence as \( x_0, x_1, x_2, \ldots \)
   - The tortoise moves one step at a time: \( x, x+1, x+2, \ldots \)
   - The hare moves two steps at a time: \( x, x+2, x+4, \ldots \)

2. **Cycle Definition**:
   - Suppose the sequence has a cycle. Let the start of the cycle be at position \( \mu \) and the length of the cycle be \( \lambda \).

3. **Meeting Point**:
   - Initially, the tortoise and the hare are at the start of the sequence, \( x_0 \).
   - After \( k \) steps, the tortoise is at \( x_k \) and the hare is at \( x_{2k} \).
   - Since there is a cycle, after a sufficient number of steps, both the tortoise and hare will enter the cycle.
   - Within the cycle, consider the positions modulo \( \lambda \). Eventually, the positions of the tortoise and hare will be congruent modulo \( \lambda \), which means they will meet.

4. **Mathematical Proof**:
   - When both the tortoise and hare are within the cycle, let’s denote their positions after \( k \) steps as \( T_k \) and \( H_k \) respectively.
   - After \( k \) steps: \( T_k = \mu + (k \mod \lambda) \) and \( H_k = \mu + (2k \mod \lambda) \)
   - Since \( \lambda \) is the length of the cycle, there exists some \( k \) such that \( k \equiv 2k \mod \lambda \).
   - Simplifying, \( k \equiv 0 \mod \lambda \) or \( k = m\lambda \) for some integer \( m \).
   - Thus, \( T_k = H_k \), and they meet within \( O(n) \) steps, where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the cycle.

#### Part B: They Do Meet in Time That Is O(n)

- **Proof of Time Complexity**:
  - The maximum number of steps before both pointers enter the cycle is \( \mu \), the distance to the start of the cycle.
  - Once both are in the cycle, the maximum number of steps needed for them to meet is \( \lambda \), the length of the cycle.
  - Therefore, the total number of steps is \( \mu + \lambda \).
  - Since \( \mu \) and \( \lambda \) are both less than \( n \) (where \( n \) is the number of elements in the list), the time complexity is \( O(n) \).

### Case 2: When there is no cycle

- **Initialization**:
  - The tortoise and hare start at the same position.
  - The tortoise moves one step at a time, and the hare moves two steps at a time.

- **No Cycle Condition**:
  - If there is no cycle, the hare will reach the end of the list before the tortoise.
  - The list has a finite length \( n \).
  - The hare will reach the end of the list in \( \lfloor n/2 \rfloor \) steps, and the tortoise will reach the end of the list in \( n \) steps.
  - Since there is no cycle, the hare will either reach the end of the list or encounter a null pointer before the tortoise.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm efficiently detects cycles in \( O(n) \) time with \( O(1) \) space complexity. When there is a cycle, the hare and tortoise will always meet within \( O(n) \) steps. When there is no cycle, the hare will reach the end of the list, proving the absence of a cycle. This algorithm ensures cycle detection with constant space, providing an optimal solution for this problem.
